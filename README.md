# Dio_ETL_Project

This is a very, very simple project for data extraction-transformation-loading.
I was unable to create new users using the Dio API, nor complete it with GPT-3.5, so I developed a CSV file with fictitious customer data from a national bank in a fictitious country (Khemed, from The Adventures of Tintin) as a country in Arabian Peninsula. On purpose, many rows have null and perhaps duplicate values, so that the data can be processed (likewise as transformation step) and then loaded or saved to a JSON file. The idea is also to create a message in the future for users who are in debt (negative balance).
Anyway, this is the most I could do without API GETs.
